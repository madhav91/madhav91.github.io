I enjoy [coding][] and [sharing][sharing] about what I learn along the way, currently living in <del>[Ahmedabad][Ahmedabad]</del> [Bengaluru][Bengaluru], after brief stays at Pune & Chandigarh, while working for TechMahindra Ltd.

I've been <strong>b & w screen </strong>lover since I started out in Computer Science and truly believe in OpenSource ideology.
I have worked with mainly Java/J2EE  and related technologies/frameworks and explored number of them, but there are no great badges around my belt.
Trying to learn a lot of things, any given time you'll find me wandering & wondering in my quest for knowledge.

I also have great interest in systems & performance engineering. Love to work with *NIX systems and trying to tweak things.

I prefer to introduce myself as,

- A Computer Engineer by Education (over-ran the college which I miss a lot),	
 
- Software Engineer by profession for a <del>Clear-Tech start up incubated at IIM Ahmedabad</del> Bengaluru based startup, etc.
 
- More importantly a Dreamer by choice.
 
- And most importantly <strong>Indian by religion.</strong>
