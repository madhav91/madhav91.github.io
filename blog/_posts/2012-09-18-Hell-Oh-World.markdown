title: Hell-Oh-World
---

Almost every single programmer has started his/her career with these words (<strong>Hell-<em>Oh</em>-World</strong>,as I call them).

Since the WP had already set up this post, I thought why not just start the blogging with editing same post and putting up something in between technical and non-technical.

Well, it was absolutely pain in the neck (being careful, decent in my language as some of my friends would notice very quickly) for a Java programmer to customize the theme, which initially looked like a design joke.

<strong>Reason I hated it initially : </strong>
Its PHP and last time had a look at it, it was final year in college.
And to be honest Java being so called OVER-VERBOSE (I like it anyway), I take pride on using something which <strong><a href="http://buytaert.net/why-php-and-not-java">is not for amateurs</a></strong>.

<strong>Outcome : </strong>
One more technology to quench my tech-lust, and justify more night outs. And more importantly a realization that you dont chose things by prejudice in Software Engineering (in case you are doing any), its all about requirements, scalability, complexity, time and most importantly <strong>MONEY</strong>.

And the fact is, <strong> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1588736/876142">Languages, libraries and frameworks don&#8217;t scale. Architectures do.</a> </strong> So Nothing wrong trying something new and keeping your options open.

Anyway coming back to the future of this blog, its more or less going to be concentrated on JAVA and related OPENSOURCE things.
Unless I MS goes OpenSource tomorrow and I find my new love, but that ain't gonna happen, is it??!

My experience so far have been nothing more than that of a noob, but then starting blog at early stage will make sure I keep track of the things I learn, and then share.
Because this is OpenSource, You learn, You Share and You make <strong>IT</strong> better.
